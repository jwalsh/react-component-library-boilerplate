  - React Testing Library: Test React components in a user-centric way.
  - Storybook: Develop and showcase components with an interactive UI component explorer.
  - Rollup: Produce optimized and efficient library bundles using the Rollup module bundler.
  - Lerna: Manage multi-package repositories (monorepos) with Lerna.
  - Yarn + PnP (Plug'n'Play): Benefit from fast and reliable dependency management using Yarn with PnP.
  - Yarn.Build: Efficiently build code in monorepos with Yarn.Build.
  - Husky: Enforce code quality standards using Git hooks with Husky.
  - Commitlint: Ensure conventional commit messages with Commitlint.
  - GitHub Actions Workflow for Tests: Run automated tests on each push and pull request with GitHub Actions.
  - Release Automation for Publishing Packages: Automate the release and publishing process for packages.
